		  <p>Acupuncture is a sub-discipline of Traditional Korean/Chinese Medicine. It has been around for thousands of years. That isn't to suggest it's out of date or meaningless to modern people. It would no longer exist if it were. Indeed, its effectiveness has been tested in many systematic reviews, with encouraging results.</p>
<h2>What Exactly is Acupuncture?</h2>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/THW_wFbTJSU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Acupuncture is based on a holistic health care framework and has been used to promote well-being and diagnose and treat disease. Because of its holistic approach to health and effectiveness has rapidly gained prominence and has steadily spread beyond Asia, reaching the rest of the world in recent years.</p>
<p>It is the process of inserting tiny, rigid, metallic needles into the skin, which are then stimulated by gentle and precise movements of the practitioner's hands or electrical stimulation.</p>
<p>Acupuncture is an ancient form of Traditional Chinese medicine. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine claim the human body contains over 2,000 acupuncture points connected by pathways or meridians. These pathways enable energy (Qi, pronounced "chee") to flow through the body, responsible for overall health. Electricity flow can be disrupted by disease. Qi flow is thought to be increased at particular points by acupuncture, thus leading to better well-being.</p>
<p>For a number of conditions, acupuncture has been found to be efficient.</p>
<p>It is not suitable for all. If you decide to see an acupuncturist, consult with your doctor first, look for a certified professional that have the necessary qualifications and credentials.</p>
<h4>What is the sensation of acupuncture?<a href="https://rivernorthacu.com/"><br /></a></h4>
<p>Acupuncture is performed using hair-thin needles. The majority of people report experiencing only some discomfort when the needle is inserted. The needle is inserted into a point that causes pain or aches. During the injection, the needles can be heated, or a mild electric current applied to them. It has been reported to energize certain people. Others claim to be at ease.</p>
<p>Incorrect needle positioning can result in pain during care. To avoid infection, needles must be sterilized. That is why it is essential to seek care from a licensed acupuncturist. The FDA regulates acupuncture needles in the same way as other medical devices are, by good manufacturing practices and single-use sterility requirements.</p>
<p>Other kinds of stimulation are also used over the acupuncture points instead of needles, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warmth (moxibustion)</li>
<li>a lot of strain (acupressure)</li>
<li>abrasion</li>
<li>Suction is a form of suction that is (cupping)</li>
<li>Electromagnetic energy impulses</li>
</ul>
<h4>Acupuncture has what effect on the body?</h4>
<p><a href="https://rivernorthacu.com/"><img class="wp-image-6670 size-large aligncenter" src="https://gqcentral.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/acupuncture-what-is-it-1024x576.jpg" alt="acupuncture - what is it" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>Acupuncture points are believed to activate the central nervous system. As a result, chemicals are released into the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. By enhancing the body's natural healing powers, these biochemical changes will promote physical and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>It has been shown in studies by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to be an effective therapy, either alone or in conjunction with traditional treatments, for the following conditions:</p>

<li>The Disease of Addiction</li>
<li>Migraines</li>
<li>Cramps during menstruation</li>

<h4>Factors to Consider When Choosing Acupuncture</h4>
<p>Acupuncture remains a point of contention because clinical experiments have not completely clarified how it functions within Western medicine. When considering acupuncture, it is essential to exercise caution.</p>
<p>Consult <a href="https://rivernorthacu.com/">your doctor</a> first about acupuncture. It is not suitable for all. Discuss all of the therapies and medications you are using (dietary supplements, prescription, and over-the-counter). Tell your doctor if you have a pacemaker, are at risk of infection, have chronic skin issues, are pregnant, or have breast or other implants. If you do not note these concerns, acupuncture can be harmful to your health.</p>
<p>Do not depend on an acupuncture practitioner's diagnosis of illness. If a doctor has given you a diagnosis, you may want to ask if it can help.</p>
<p>Select an acupuncture practitioner who is certified. A licensed or approved doctor may be referred to you by your primary care physician. Friends and family members can also make referrals. It is not necessary to be a doctor to practice it or become a licensed acupuncturist.</p>
<p>While not all states require acupuncturists to obtain a license to practice, approximately 30 states have developed training requirements for acupuncture certification. Although not all licensed acupuncturists are physicians, the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture will include a list of physicians who practice it.</p>
<p>Take into account the expenses and insurance coverage. Before beginning care, inquire with the acupuncturist about the number of treatments needed and the cost of the treatments. Some insurance companies pay for acupuncture, while others do not. It is crucial to determine if your insurance covers acupuncture before beginning treatment.</p>
<h4>How Does Acupuncture Work?</h4>
<p>It is based on the traditional eastern medicine theory that energy, known as qi, flows through your body through 12 pathways known as meridian. Meridians connect all parts of the body from head to toe, allowing for communication between them through the movement of qi, blood, and body fluids.</p>
<p>When it is healthy, your wellbeing is good and your body systems function in harmony. However, if the flow of qi in your body is interrupted or becomes unbalanced, it may lead to illness (pain, depression, confusion, or other physical or emotional dysfunction.).</p>
<p>Acupuncture, according to traditional Korean/Chinese medicine practitioners, restores the flow of qi and thus restores health. To help rebalance Qi or energy, acupuncture needles are gently inserted through the skin at various key points.</p>
<p>Reduces pain by biochemical pathways including opioid peptides and stimulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, as well as improvements in neurotransmitters, hormones, or immune function.</p>
<h4>Strategies For Managing Anxiety</h4>
<p>Acupuncture eliminates tension on a proactive basis. This is how it is done.</p>
<p>Acupuncture is a form of Traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to alleviate stress and improve general well-being. Now let's take a look at five different pieces of evidence in support of its efficacy for stress and anxiety relief.</p>
<p>Yes, there are needles, but they aren't painful. We use extremely fine needles inserted just under the skin to activate our body's acupressure points and meridians and increase the flow of Qi (pronounced "chee"), or vital energy in our systems, to restore the body's tension equilibrium.</p>
<p>Your doctor will decide the best points to position the needles on your body after a thorough examination. You'll lie down on a padded table, and your acupuncturist will begin inserting needles with a light tap at each location. The needles are so perfect that you won't even notice them. There may be one that feels "powerful" or similar to a mosquito bite.</p>
<p>Acupuncture sessions allow for some downtime. Aside from the soothing effects of the needles, the session itself calms and relaxes you. After inserting the needles, you will rest for about 30 minutes to enable the procedure to take effect. You should listen to soft music, rest your eyes, or even fall asleep during this period.</p>
<h4>Acupuncture is a drug-free treatment modality</h4>
<p>Acupuncture has no adverse side effects. You won't have to think about the negative impact that specific treatments have because acupuncture is a drug-free treatment modality. Furthermore, it would help if you were sure that there would be no adverse drug reactions with your current medications. Your acupuncturist will prescribe a therapy frequency that will help you meet your stress-reduction goals.</p>
<p>Acupuncture works by using the body's internal pathways to provide relief. When the fine needles activate nerves under the skin, the nerve sends a message to the brain, asking it to release endorphins, our natural painkillers. These natural brain chemicals calm us and make us feel euphoric or satisfied. Acupuncture also assists our bodies in naturally reducing inflammation and discomfort, all of which can be exacerbated by chronic stress.</p>
<p>Attending your appointment entails devoting much-needed time to self-care. Unlike taking a pill and soldiering on, arranging and attending an acupuncture appointment redirects your attention to yourself.</p>
<p>Changing our mindsets and patterns is an essential part of stress reduction. Acupuncture not only works to change your internal stress-induced chemistry but keeping a regular therapy schedule often lets you make time for yourself and re-prioritize your stressful behaviors.</p>
